# LISTS
print("\nLISTS")
#       arrays (adjustable storage containers)
#       Functions: append, remove, pop, insert, sort, clear

# TUPLES
print("\nTUPLES")
#       a Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable
#       is used to group together related data
#       Functions: count, index

# SETS
print("\nSETS")
#       a collection which is unordered, unindexed, and does not retain duplicate values
#       faster than a list in search time
#       Functions: add, remove, clear, update, union, difference, intersection

# remove() utensils.remove("fork")
# clear() utensils.clear()
# dishes = {"bowl", "plate", "cup", "knife"}

# union() dinner_table = utensils.union(dishes)
# difference() print(utensils.difference(dishes))  # what utensils have that dishes doesn't (1st does that 2nd doesn't)
# intersection() print(utensils.intersection(dishes))

# DICTIONARIES
#       a changeable, unordered collection of unique keys with value pairs
#       fast because they use hashing, allow us to access a value quickly

# list comprehension = a way to create a new list with less syntax
